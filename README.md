# Quantum_Kodes

Quantum_Kodes is an experimental project around Quantum Computing with an integration of Machine Learning (ML) concepts. 
This project aims to explore the potential of quantum algorithms and simulations using the Qiskit simulator or online computing services, and to investigate how quantum computing paradigms can enhance machine learning applications.

## About The Project

Quantum computing represents a groundbreaking computing paradigm that leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to process information in ways that traditional computers cannot. By integrating machine learning concepts into the quantum computing framework, this project seeks to uncover new efficiencies and capabilities within the realm of computational intelligence.
